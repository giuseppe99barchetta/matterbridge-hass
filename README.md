This plugin allows you to expose the Home Assistant devices and individual entities to Matter.

It is the ideal companion of the official [Matterbridge Home Assistant Application](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-home-assistant-addon/blob/main/README.md).

Features:

- This plugin can be used with Matterbridge running in the Matterbridge Official Application or outside Home Assistant.
- The state of the Home Assistant core is checked before starting. The plugin waits for the core to be `RUNNING`.
- The connection with Home Assistant is made throught WebSocket: so Matterbridge can be also in another network if the Home Assistant host is reachable.
- The connection with Home Assistant can be also made with ssl WebSocket (i.e. wss://homeassistant:8123). Self signed certificates are also supported.
- It is possible to filter entities and devices by Area.
- It is possible to filter entities and devices by Label.
- It is possible to select from a list the individual entities to include in the white or black list. Select by name, id or entity_id.
- It is possible to select from a list the devices to include in the white or black list. Select by name or id.
- It is possible to select from a list the entities to include in the device entity black list.
- It is possible to pickup from a list the split entities or to select them adding a label.
- It is possible to postfix the Matter device serialNumber and the Matter device name to avoid collision with other instances.
- Support **Apple Home Adaptive Lighting**. See https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge/discussions/390.
- Support **transition time**.
- Support system unit **CELSIUS** and **FAHRENHEIT**.
- Jest test coverage = 100%.

## How to use filters and select

> Read the explanation [here](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/discussions/186).

## Naming issues on the controller side explained

> For naming issues (especially upsetting with Alexa and Google), read the explanation and the solution [here](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/discussions/86).

## Quick install guide

For new users I suggest to start following this list:

- create an [Home Assistant Token](README.md#token)
- create an Home Assistant Label that will be used to [filter](README.md#filter-by-label) the devices and entities in Home Assistant
- create an Home Assistant Label that will be used to [split](README.md#split-by-label) the device entities in Home Assistant
- find your [Host name or Address](README.md#host)
- add them to the config and restart

Now add the `label for filter` you created before to each device you want to expose to Matter (or to each device entity if you want only some of the device entities).

Add also the `label for split` you created before to each device entity you want to expose like a single Matter device.

Restart, verify that everything is like you intended.

Pair Matterbridge to your controller.

## Supported device entities:

| Domain       | Supported states                           | Supported attributes                                                                    |

| cover        | open, closed, opening, closing             | current_position                                                                        |
| climate      | off, heat, cool, heat_cool, auto           | current_temperature, temperature, target_temp_low, target_temp_high, min_temp, max_temp |

| vacuum (2)   | idle, cleaning, paused, docked, returning  |                                                                                         |
| button       |                                            |                                                                                         |
| remote       | on, off                                    |                                                                                         |
| select       |                                            | options                                                                                 |
| media_player | on, off, play, pause, stop, previous, next |                                                                                         |

(1) - Supported preset_modes: auto, low, medium, high.

(2) - The Apple Home crashes if the Rvc is inside the bridge. If you pair with Apple Home use the server mode in the config (it will create an autonomous device with its QR code in the Devices panel of the Home page) and disable or split all other entities that are not the rvc.

These domains are supported also like individual and split entities.

## Supported individual entities:

| Domain        | Category    |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| automation    | Automations |
| scene         | Scenes      |
| script        | Scripts     |
| input_boolean | Helpers     |
| input_button  | Helpers     |
| input_select  | Helpers     |

These individual entities are exposed as on/off outlets. When the outlet is turned on, it triggers the associated entity. After triggering, the outlet automatically switches back to the off state. The helper of domain input_boolean maintains the on/off state.

These domains are supported also like device entities and split entities.

## Supported sensors:

| Domain | Supported state class | Supported device class     | Unit           | Matter device type |
| ------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| sensor | measurement           | temperature                | °C, °F         | temperatureSensor  |

| sensor | measurement           | carbon_monoxide            | ppm (2)        | airQualitySensor   |
| sensor | measurement           | nitrogen_dioxide           | ugm3 (2)       | airQualitySensor   |
| sensor | measurement           | ozone                      | ugm3 (2)       | airQualitySensor   |

| sensor | measurement           | pm1                        | ugm3 (2)       | airQualitySensor   |
| sensor | measurement           | pm25                       | ugm3 (2)       | airQualitySensor   |
| sensor | measurement           | pm10                       | ugm3 (2)       | airQualitySensor   |

(1) - If the air quality entity is not standard (e.g. state class = measurement, device class = aqi and state number range 0-500), it is possible to set a regexp. See below.

(2) - On the controller side.

(3) - Must be an entity that belongs to a device. Battery alone is not a device in Matter.

When a Home Assistant device exposes exactly one `switch` together with electrical sensors (`voltage`, `current`, `power`, or `energy`), the electrical measurement clusters are added to that switch's Matter outlet endpoint. This lets Apple Home associate consumption with the outlet. Devices with no switch or more than one switch continue to expose electrical measurements as a separate electrical sensor endpoint.

## Supported binary_sensors:

| Domain        | Supported device class (1)           | Matter device type  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| binary_sensor | window, garage_door, door, vibration | contactSensor       |
| binary_sensor | motion, occupancy, presence          | occupancySensor     |
| binary_sensor | cold                                 | waterFreezeDetector |
| binary_sensor | moisture                             | waterLeakDetector   |
| binary_sensor | smoke                                | smokeCoAlarm        |
| binary_sensor | carbon_monoxide                      | smokeCoAlarm        |
| binary_sensor | battery                              | powerSource         |

(1) - A binary_sensor without a device class is exposed like a generic contactSensor.

## Supported events:

| Domain | Supported events                                         | Matter device type |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| event  | single, single_push, press, initial_press, multi_press_1 | genericSwitch      |
| event  | double, double_press, double_push, multi_press_2         | genericSwitch      |
| event  | long, long_push, long_press, hold_press                  | genericSwitch      |

If any commonly used integration use other useful events, let me know please.

### Naming issues explained

For the naming issues (expecially upsetting with Alexa) read the explanation and the three possible actual solutions [here](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/discussions/86).

### Usage warning

> **Warning:** Since this plugin takes the devices from Home Assistant, it cannot be paired back to Home Assistant. This would lead to duplicate devices! If you run Matterbridge like a Home Assistant Add-on and also use other plugins to expose their devices to Home Assistant, then change to child bridge mode and pair the other plugins to Home Assistant and this plugin wherever you need it.

## Sponsoring

If you like this project and find it useful, please consider giving it a **star** on [GitHub](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass) and **sponsoring** it.

## Prerequisites

### Matterbridge

See the complete guidelines on [Matterbridge](https://matterbridge.io) for more information.

## How to install the plugin

Just open the frontend, select the matterbridge-hass plugin and click on install. If you are using Matterbridge with `Docker`, all plugins are already loaded in the container so you just need to select the matterbridge-hass plugin and add it. If you are using Matterbridge with the `Matterbridge Home Assistant Application` (formerly known as add-on), you need to install the matterbridge-hass plugin.

## How to use it

There are 2 different source of Matter devices coming from matterbridge-hass plugin:

- Regular devices with their entities that use the main whiteList, blackList and deviceEntityBlackList. You find them in Home Assistant at http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/devices/dashboard.

- Individual entities with domain scene, script, automation. You find these special entities in Home Assistant at http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/automation/dashboard, http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/scene/dashboard and http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/script/dashboard.

- Individual entities (helpers) with domain input_boolean, input_button. You find these special entities in Home Assistant at http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/helpers.

- Individual entities from template. You find these special entities in Home Assistant at http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/helpers.

All the individual entities use the main whiteList, blackList.

Since the release 0.4.0 it is also possible to pickup any device entity and split ("decompose") it to make it an independent Matter device.

## Config

You may need to set some config values in the frontend (wait that the plugin has been configured before changing the config):

I suggest to always use the filters by Area and Label or the whiteList adding each entity or device you want to expose to Matter.

If any device or entity creates issues put it in the blackList.

### Host

Your Home Assistance address (eg. ws://homeassistant.local:8123 or ws://IP-ADDRESS:8123). Use the IP only if it is stable. It is also possible to use ssl websocket (i.e. wss://). If you use selfsigned certificates you need to provide either the ca certificate or to unselect rejectUnauthorized. With normal certificates you don't need ca certificate and rejectUnauthorized should be selected.

### Token

Home Assistant long term token used to connect to Home Assistant with WebSocket. Click on your user name in the bottom left corner of the Home Assistand frontend, then Security and create a Long-Lived Access Tokens.

### CA Certificate Path

Fully qualified path to the SSL ca certificate file. This is only needed if you use a self-signed certificate and rejectUnauthorized is enabled.

### Reject Unauthorized

Ignore SSL certificate errors. It allows to connect to Home Assistant with self-signed certificates without providing the ca certificate.

### Reconnect Timeout

Reconnect timeout in seconds.

### Reconnect Retries

Number of times to try to reconnect before giving up.

### Filter By Area

Filter devices and individual entities by area. If enabled, only devices, individual entities, and split entities in the selected area will be exposed. If disabled, all devices, individual entities, and split entities will be exposed. A device is also exposed if it has any entities that satisfy the filters.

### Filter By Label

Filter devices and individual entities by label. If enabled, only devices, individual entities, and split entities with the selected label will be exposed. If disabled, all devices, individual entities, and split entities will be exposed. A device is also exposed if it has any entities that satisfy the filters.

### Whitelist

If the whiteList is defined only the devices, the individual and split entities included are exposed to Matter. Use the device/entity name or the device/entity id.

### Blacklist

If the blackList is defined the devices, the individual and split entities included will not be exposed to Matter. Use the device/entity name or the device/entity id.

### Device Entity Blacklist

List of entities not to be exposed for a single device. Enter in the first field the name of the device and in the second field add all the entity names you want to exclude for that device.

### Domain Whitelist

Only entities whose domain is listed here will be exposed. Leave this list empty to expose all domains. Enter the domain name (i.e. switch, light, sensor).

### Domain Blacklist

Entities whose domain is listed here will be excluded. Leave this list empty to exclude no domains. Enter the domain name (i.e. automation, scene, button).

### Split Entities

> DEPRECATED: use `Split By Label`

The device entities in the list will be exposed like an independent device and removed from their device. Use the entity id (i.e. switch.plug_child_lock).

Let's make an example.

Suppose we have a device named "Computer plug" with 3 entities:

- id switch.computer_plug named "Computer plug Power" that is the main Power for the plug
- id switch.computer_plug_child_lock named "Computer plug Child lock" that is the child lock for the plug
- id temperature.computer_plug named "Computer plug Device temperature" that is the device temperature (very used in the zigbee world)

Without further setup, the controller will show 2 switch with the same name (difficult to distinguish them). Alexa will show 3 devices "Computer plug", "First plug" and "Second plug".

Solution:

- add switch.computer_plug_child_lock (use entity_id) to splitEntities and restart.
- if you use the whiteList, select your switch.computer_plug_child_lock (will show up with the entity name "Computer plug Child lock") and restart.

In this way, the controller will show one switch with name "Computer plug" and a second with name "Computer plug Child lock".

If you don't need the device temperature, just add it to deviceEntityBlackList.

If you want a more technical explanation for the naming issues (expecially upsetting with Alexa) read the explanation [here](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/discussions/86).

> **Adding an entity to splitEntities doesn't automatically add it to the whiteList, so it must be added manually if you use the whiteList.**

> **If you enable the filters (area and label), the split entity must also satisfy the filter criteria.**

### Split By Label

Any device entity with this label will be split. This is faster to setup then splitEntities on huge setups.

> **Adding splitByLabel to an entity doesn't automatically add it to the whiteList, so it must be added manually if you use the whiteList.**

> **If you enable the filters (area and label), the split entity must also satisfy the filter criteria.**

### Split Name Strategy

Strategy used for split entity names. "Entity name": use the entity name (i.e. Child Lock) if it exists; otherwise, use the friendly name. "Friendly name": use the friendly name (i.e. Computer Plug Child Lock) if it exists; otherwise, use the entity name. Changing this value will cause you to lose the device configuration in your controller, and you may need to pair the controller again.

### Controller Strategy

Strategy used to expose multiple device types. 'Merge' combines non-overlapping device types on the main endpoint. 'Matter' creates a separate endpoint for each device type. Use the Merge strategy for legacy controllers (more then one application device type on the same bridged endpoint is not strictly compliant in Matter 1.5.0). Changing this setting may require you to pair the controller again cause the entire node is composed differently.

### Air Quality Regex

Custom regex pattern to match air quality sensors that don't follow the standard Air Quality entity sensor.

**Examples:**

- For sensor entities ending with `_air_quality`: `^sensor\..*_air_quality$`.
- For sensor entities containing `air_quality` anywhere: `^sensor\..*air_quality.*$`.
- For a single specific entity: `sensor.air_quality_sensor` (exact entity ID).
- For two specific entities: `^(sensor\.kitchen_air_quality|sensor\.living_room_aqi)$`.

If your setup has only one air quality sensor, you can simply put the exact entity ID here (e.g., `sensor.air_quality_sensor`) and it will match that specific entity.

### Enable Server Rvc

Enable the Robot Vacuum Cleaner in server mode. Apple Home will crash unless you use this mode! Don't try it with Apple Home cause the bridge will become unstable even if you remove it after.

In addition to this well known bugs, the rvc must be a single device, it cannot have any other device types like switch or whatever. So if your integration adds any other device types, blacklist or split them.

### Discard Hidden Entities

If enabled (default), the plugin discards entities that are hidden in Home Assistant (i.e. entities whose `hidden_by` field is not `null` in the entity registry). Hidden entities will not be exposed as device entities, individual entities, or split entities.

### Virtual Control Label

Label used to enable virtual controls on entities. If set, the plugin creates one virtual control for each entity with the selected label. These virtual controls are intended for accessibility and let you send commands to entities that are not directly supported by the controller, such as `media_player.samsung_tv`, with simple voice-friendly switches. Virtual controls are exposed as switch entities: turning one on triggers the command, and the plugin automatically turns it off again afterward.

Supported virtual control domains:

| Domain       | Feature        | Service              | Virtual control       |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| media_player | TURN_ON        | TURN_ON              | Turn ON + name        |
|              | TURN_OFF       | TURN_OFF             | Turn OFF + name       |

Use this option to create simple voice-friendly switches like `Play TV`, `Pause TV`, or `Turn ON TV` for media_player domain: with Siri you can simply say `Hey Siri Play TV`.

Example:

Let's say you have a device named `Samsung TV` with a media_player entity `media_player.samsung_tv`.

If you set `Virtual Control Label` to `matterbridge-virtual` and assign that label to the media_player entity in Home Assistant, the plugin checks which media player features are supported and creates one virtual switch for each supported command.

For example:

- if the device supports `TURN_ON`, the plugin creates `Turn ON Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `TURN_OFF`, the plugin creates `Turn OFF Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `PLAY`, the plugin creates `Play Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `PAUSE`, the plugin creates `Pause Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `STOP`, the plugin creates `Stop Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `VOLUME_MUTE`, the plugin creates `Mute Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `VOLUME_STEP`, the plugin creates `Volume Down Samsung TV` and `Volume Up Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `PREVIOUS_TRACK`, the plugin creates `Previous Track Samsung TV`
- if the device supports `NEXT_TRACK`, the plugin creates `Next Track Samsung TV`

When you turn on one of these virtual switches, the plugin sends the corresponding `media_player` service command to that entity and then automatically turns the switch off again.

So, if your `Samsung TV` only supports `TURN_ON`, `TURN_OFF` and `VOLUME_STEP`, you will get these four virtual controls:

- `Turn ON Samsung TV`
- `Turn OFF Samsung TV`
- `Volume Down Samsung TV`
- `Volume Up Samsung TV`
